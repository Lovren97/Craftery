# Craftery
University project for Software Design course. Choosen as #1 App of course at Faculty of electrical engineering and computing.

The premise of an app was something like eBay, but only for items hand made or, if you will, crafted, hence the name Craftery. Also you
can post stories. :) 

App is on Google Play Store:
